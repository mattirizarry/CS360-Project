# Sprint 1 Retrospective

## What is a "retrospective?"

A retrospective occurs at the end of a sprint. The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. During the Sprint Retrospective, the team discusses:

### What went well in the Sprint

Take the opportunity to discuss with your team about your wins of the Sprint. Did you learn a new skill? Were you able to collaborate with a new teammate? Once you talk about your wins, you should further take the time to consider reasons for the successes. For example, I was able to learn a new language because my teammate took the time and pair programmed with me. Talking about wins lets the team establish practices that help the team continue to excel.

### What could be improved

Take the opportunity to discuss with your team about things you feel could have been improved over the sprint. Maybe a team member had a hard time adapting to project design patterns, but isn't speaking up about it. If you don't speak up about it, your project manager cannot reallocate resources and get team members the help they need. This is just as important as discussing wins.

### What we will commit to improve in the next sprint

Once you have found out the wins and the pain points of the previous sprint, work as a team to identify solutions to the problems. Take our project for example. I was very proud of the work done, however, I felt that I as a project manager should have been using GitHub to more effectively track team progress. So going forward, we agreed that we would put all issues into GitHub, and I would teach you all how to effectively use it. It is too late to implement this in the previous sprint, but thinking about this before the next one helps you to start on the metaphorical right foot. 

# CS360 Sprint 1 Retrospective

Once we discussed the purpose of the sprint retrospective, we quickly did a retrospective for our past sprint.

## What went well in the sprint

Everyone did quality work, and got their work done on time. Everyone was very flexible and willing to meet outside of class. Everyone was easily reachable within a reasonable time-frame, and was friendly to interact with.

## What could be improved

General project management practices could be improved, such as a better place to store all of our files such as the `documentation.tex` and the `organization.tex` files. Also, we can improve how we track individual work being done by taking advantage of the GitHub issues tab.

## What will we commit to improve in the next sprint

In the next sprint, we will utilize GitHub to its fullest potential by leveraging GitHub issues in conjunction with a project management methodology called SCRUM. You can find resources on SCRUM on the internet, or with sites such as `scrum.org` and `atlassian.com`. They both have comprehensive information on what SCRUM is, and what it tries to accomplish.

### 1. Sprint Planning / Kickoff
This is the first meeting of the sprint. Tasks will be divided up, and will be assigned to individuals. Anything that is not immediately assigned will go into the project backlog. For our project, we will use a Kanban board in the `Projects` tab of our repository to track this.

### 2. Daily Scrum
For our purposes, we will not have a daily SCRUM meeting, but a twice weekly SCRUM after class. The purpose of the daily SCRUM is to identify any roadblocks and to ask for extra help. For example, I might come to a team member and say, "Hey, I need you to finish this task before I can start on mine." Or, if I was struggling with a task, I might say, "Hey, I was really having trouble connecting with the database. Is there anyone with more experience on this with me who could assist?" Your project manager will find you resources to help.

### 3. Sprint Review
This meeting concludes the iterative process of the Sprint, and any incomplete issues at this point will be put back into the project backlog.

### 4. Sprint Retrospective
I've already covered this enough above, but it is the last step of the process and it aims to help improve the next sprint.
