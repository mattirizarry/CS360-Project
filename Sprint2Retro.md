# CS360 Sprint 2 Retrospective

## Areas that we succeeded 
- Assigned Workload **10/10**
- Communication **10/10**
- Scheduling **10/10**

## Areas that we need improvement in 
- Quality of Work **9/10**
    - Work ahead next time
- Project Organization **8.5/10**
    - More comprehensive GitHub issues, less ambigious issues. Less redundant. e.g. UML diagrams having issues for both documentation and presentation.
- Task Assignment and Division **7/10**

## What will we commit to improve in the next sprint?

More diligent with GitHub, especially considering that we are going to be developing software in Sprint 3. This will be paramount. Task division and assignment sooner rather than later. Ensure less redundancy in the GitHub issues.
