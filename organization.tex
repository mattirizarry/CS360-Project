%250 words minimum for each sprint
	\subsection{Sprint 1}%How/where did the group meet?  How often did you meet as an entire team?  Who’s the Project Manager for this sprint?

        For this sprint, Matthew Irizarry, was the project manager. We decided to meet twice a week after class, for approximately 30-45 minutes each time. We ended up going to the Commons to meet in person, as there was always somewhere for us to sit. We generally discussed quick progress updates, and wins to celebrate. However, we did recognize a few areas for improvement around scheduling and organizing documents into one place, but a solution was quickly implemented. Overall, the sprint was very efficient and effective, and allowed us to complete our work fully and in a timely manner. We plan to have a Sprint 1 Retrospective to learn from what we did, and improve on our process in the next sprint.

%Gantt charts cover the tasks/time commitments and estimations for the entire project.  We will have four iterations of the Gantt Chart, with iteration focusing on a specific sprint.

\subsection{Gantt Chart v1:}
%200 words minimum to describe the focus for this sprint.
%Identify the location for the Gantt Chart created during Sprint 1.  Should be clearly labeled in the project directory.

A Gantt chart is a project management tool that provides a detailed visual representation of a project's timeline, tasks, and progress. The Gantt chart displays the tasks that were worked on and completed during the first sprint. Tasks completed in the first sprint include: class readings, planning, task distribution, presentation, documentation, and CATME evaluations. These tasks aided the team in the planning and organization of the remainder of the project and allowed for the team to familiarize themselves with each other and work together better in future sprints.

The GANTT chart for this sprint has been included in the submission archive that was uploaded to blackboard.

%---------------------------Progress Visibility---------------------------------------------------
\section{Progress Visibility}
%200 words minimum for each sprint.
%For each sprint, explain how each member of the group is progressing with assigned tasks and how that progress is shared with the group.  Also, explain how the group is progressing with assigned tasks and how that progress is shared with the client.  Examples:  how does the group assign tasks?  How to group members know tasks assigned to them?  How do group members communicate when assigned tasks are complete, need assistance, or waiting on other tasks to be completed first?
\subsection{Sprint 1 Progress Visibility}

For this sprint, we focused on establishing channels of communication, meeting times that worked for everyone, and just generally got to know each other. We successfully divided up the tasks for the technical documentation, the presentation, and the organizational documentation. After that, we got straight to work. There was never any point where we had to remind individuals to stay on task, but I did make sure to give reminders of what was upcoming. Everyone was able to use these quick reminders to stay on task and get their work done, which was really nice. We used our primary channel of communication, Discord, to handle any situations that we could over text, and whenever necessary would utilize Discord or an in person meeting to clarify things that couldn't be clarified over text. Both meetings with Galloway Games went well, and we were able to use these meetings to dive deeper where necessary, and pivot away from work that wasn't within the scope of this sprint, or the project whatsoever.

%---------------------------Software Process Model---------------------------------------------------
\section{Software Process Model}
%200 words minimum
%Describe in this section the Software Process Model used and how it increases the quality of the final deliverables.  The team should also define the quality control steps that are used in the Software Process Model.

For this project, we find it paramount that we be able to effectively plan in the long term, but also be able to make changes on the fly if requested by the client, or if it is demanded by a change in software or something out of our control. As such, we will be adopting the Agile organizational model. Comparing this to something like the waterfall approach, which is a linear software development model, agile allows a team to make iterative changes over several sprints. This allows for better pivoting when necessary, and encourages small iterative development over large swaths of changes all at once. Doing smaller, iterative changes like this allows bugs to be caught earlier, and squashed with less effort. This will have a significant impact in the long run, not just in the quality of the software, but especially in the amount of time that will be saved from this iterative approach.

%---------------------------Risk Management--------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Risk Management}
%Use this section to describe the team's approach to risk management.

\subsection{Risk Identification}
%List, categorize, and prioritize all potential risks associated with the project.

The understanding of when a risk occurs can be crucial to making progress as a team in developing software. This is because if you let a risk go unnoticed it can cause other problems to occur beyond the initial risk and something that was once small is now a burden to the entire team and all resources and time are now committed to solving these other problems instead of progressing in development. The key solution to identifying risks is tight communication between members whether it is through code review, communication schedules, or setting up meetings. These frequent communication checks can make sure everyone is on the same page and see common risks.

\subsection{Risk Planning}
%Give overviews of plans for specific risk types

Risk planning is the process of looking in the future and examining possible risks because if you can identify a risk before it comes you can plan your workflow around said risk to minimize any conflict. You can separate these risks into 3 categories: Known Knowns, Known Unknowns, and Unknown Unknowns. The first 2 options are more feasible to plan around as the team knows to some degree what and/or when to expect the risks. However, the most dangerous is Unknown Unknown as there is no telling when it will hit your team or what the exact issue will be. Regardless of which risk you encounter as long as you have great communication, software organization, and teamwork you can stay poised for any risk that comes at you.

\subsection{Risk Monitoring}
%Give overviews of how the team will monitor specific types of risks

Monitoring the risk is quite simple with the software architecture that the team will implement. GitHub has an ‘Issues’ tab that we can use to keep track of any problems software-wise that can happen where teammates can comment on the issue and work together to resolve the risk. Team dynamics risks such as the possibility of losing a member, scheduling issues, or disagreement can be solved with meetings and double-checking that work is split fairly amongst members so that tasks can be done as efficiently as possible.
